### What is the name of your project?    
 **Cook2Gather** \
  The coolest conversations happen over meals :grin:
### Project Description and Future Scope
  When there is a global pandemic spearating you from your loved ones, it can be hard to stay connected and find online activitites to keep you occupied. \
That is where Cook2Gather comes in. It is a website that allows you to connect with your friends over cooking and baking. \
Picking and agreeing on restaurants to dine at is already hard enough, so we decided to implement a **generate a random recipe feature** to take the guesswork out. \
*Learning to cook* is a skill so many people are looking to - especially during the quarantine. What better way than doing it with the people you love.

Simply ger a new recipe and then a streaming link to send to friends and family. \
Our website is deisgned to be easily accesible by even the least tech savvy people - making it perfect for the granparents looking to connect with their grandkids over a batch of cookies made accross the country. \
Once you're done cooking, you can show off your favourite recipes on the submissions page.

Future Scope: 
 - Sorting feature with tags to group the categories of food. 
 - A feature to be able to rate your favourite recipies. 
 - A way of generating random recipes given the users' input for what indgredients they already hav at hand.


### Who did you design this project for?
  - We aim to have no age bars and this project is for anyone who loves experimenting. \
  - Adding to the theme of Ivy Hacks 2020 *Building Bridges, Breaking Barriers* we as a team have tried to help people all across the globe connect with their loved ones.
  
### What was your inspiration for this project?
  Our greatest learning was to **focus on the problem, not the solution**
  - Connectivity has always been a problem. As a matter of fact, the pandemic has improved connectivity. 
  - The biggest accomplishment - We've all learnt a lot. Not just a thing or two.
